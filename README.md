Project Description: Operating System with GUI using Qt, FCFS Scheduling, Best Fit Memory Allocation, and Banker's Algorithm for Deadlock Detection

Project Overview:
The Operating System (OS) project aims to develop a comprehensive system that incorporates a graphical user interface (GUI) designed using Qt. The project utilizes C++ as the backend programming language, integrating various essential components such as First-Come-First-Serve (FCFS) scheduling algorithm, Best Fit memory allocation algorithm, and Banker's algorithm for deadlock detection. The primary objective is to create an efficient and user-friendly operating system that handles task scheduling, memory management, and detects and resolves deadlock situations.

Features and Functionality:
1. GUI using Qt: The project will provide a visually appealing and intuitive graphical user interface developed using the Qt framework. The GUI will allow users to interact with the operating system, access various functionalities, and monitor system performance.

2. FCFS Scheduling Algorithm: The OS will implement the First-Come-First-Serve scheduling algorithm, which ensures that the tasks are executed based on their arrival time. FCFS guarantees fairness and simplicity by executing tasks in the order they are received, which can be beneficial for certain workloads.

3. Best Fit Memory Allocation: The system will utilize the Best Fit memory allocation algorithm to efficiently manage memory resources. Best Fit aims to allocate memory blocks to processes based on the smallest available block that can accommodate the process size. This algorithm helps reduce memory fragmentation and optimizes memory utilization.

4. Banker's Algorithm for Deadlock Detection: The OS will employ Banker's algorithm to detect and resolve deadlock situations. Banker's algorithm works by simulating resource allocation and evaluating the potential for deadlock occurrence. If a deadlock is detected, the system will take appropriate actions to resolve it, such as resource reallocation or process termination.

5. System Monitoring and Reporting: The operating system will provide real-time monitoring and reporting functionalities to enable users to observe system performance. This includes visualizing task execution, memory allocation, and deadlock detection status, allowing users to make informed decisions and troubleshoot any issues that arise.

6. User-Friendly Interface: The GUI will be designed to provide an intuitive user experience, enabling users to easily navigate through different functionalities, access system statistics, and configure system settings. The interface will prioritize simplicity and clarity, ensuring that users can interact with the OS without technical complexities.

7. Robustness and Error Handling: The project will focus on robust error handling mechanisms to prevent system crashes, data corruption, or other unexpected behavior. The OS will implement proper exception handling, input validation, and error reporting to maintain system stability and reliability.

Conclusion:
The OS project presents a comprehensive operating system implementation with a GUI developed using Qt, backend functionality written in C++, and essential features such as FCFS scheduling, Best Fit memory allocation, and Banker's algorithm for deadlock detection. By combining these components, the operating system aims to provide an efficient, user-friendly, and reliable computing environment.
